## Biography

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student in the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/). 
Also, I was a visiting student in the Medical Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yefeng Zheng (IEEE & AIMBE Fellow)](https://sites.google.com/site/yefengzheng/), in 2025.
Before that, I received my M.Phil. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Lei Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/indexlzhu/home?authuser=0) and [Prof. Anyi Rao](https://anyirao.com/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), in 2024, and the B.Eng. degree from [School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering](https://www.tju.edu.cn/info/1044/1251.htm) at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), in 2022.

My research interests mainly lie in Low-level Vision, Generative Modeling, and Medical Image Analysis.

Thanks for your reading! Welcome to contact me about research collaboration, please don't hesitate to drop me emails if you are interested in my research.
