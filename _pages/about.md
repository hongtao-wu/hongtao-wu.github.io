## Biography

My name is Hongtao Wu. I received my bachelor degree in Measurement and Control Technology and Instruments from the [School of Precision Instrument and Opto-Electronics Engineering](https://www.tju.edu.cn/info/1044/1251.htm) (National Pilot College) at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/), and I used to be a member of the honours programme ([Engineering Science Experimental Class](https://zs.tju.edu.cn/ym21/xyzy1/jmyqygdzgcxy.htm), now known as Wang Shourong Class) in college, where I was supervised by Prof. [Hui Yu](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/yuhui/en/index.htm#shjj) and Prof. [Chunguang Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xgr2TsYAAAAJ&hl=en) in undergraduate graduation thesis and National College Student Innovation Program. I am currently a second year M.Phil. student under the supervision of Prof. [Lei Zhu](https://sites.google.com/site/indexlzhu/home?authuser=0) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Now, Iâ€™m focusing on video restoration and medical image analysis, in partnership with PhD candidate [Yijun Yang](https://yijun-yang.github.io/).

## Research Interests

* Video restoration under real-world adverse conditions.
* Efficient neural network for low-level applications (ViTs, Diffusions, Mambas).
* Medical image analysis for clinical application.





## News
